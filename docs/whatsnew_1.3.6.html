<h1>Upgrade Instructions from v1.3.5 to 1.3.6</h1>
<p>If you are upgrading <strong><u>from Zen Cart v1.3.5</u></strong>, the process is simple:<br>
  - compare all the changed files with the files on your own site... and re-apply your customizations to the new files<br>
  - upload the new files (with your customizations added) to your site<br>
  - upload the <span class="filename">zc_install</span> folder to your server, and run <span class="filename">zc_install/index.php</span> <br>
  ... select <strong>Database Upgrade</strong> from the System Inspection screen. Apply the required updates. </p>
<p>If you are upgrading <strong><u>from a version prior to v1.3.5</u></strong>, please follow the instructions in the &quot;<a href="2.readme_how_to_upgrade.html">how to upgrade</a>&quot; documentation in the /docs folder. </p>
<h1>IMPORTANT NOTES </h1>
<ul>
<li><span class="style1">SECURITY:</span><span class="error"> Please be sure to review and apply the <a href="./important_site_security_recommendations.html" target="_blank">Site Security Recommendations</a> to your site prior to taking your shop &quot;live&quot;.</span> If you are uncertain about how site security applies to you, talk to your web host to ensure that you have proper measures in place. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  </li>
<li><span class="style1">Stylesheet Changes:</span>  There are some important stylesheet additions and a few changes.<br>
  <br> 
<ol>
<li>Two new styles were added: <br>
  <br>
  <span class="filename">.hiddenField {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display: none;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
.visibleField {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display: inline;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
  </span></li>
  <br>
  <li>There was a conversion from <span class="filename">&lt;div class=&quot;navMainSearch forward&quot;&gt;</span> to <br>
    <span class="filename">&lt;div id=&quot;navMainSearch&quot;&gt;</span> in the<span class="filename"> tpl_header.php</span> file. If you wish to &quot;not&quot; convert that part of your header, you will need to add the following to your stylesheet <br>
    <span class="filename"><br>
      /**************************/<br>
  /* backward compatibility, to be removed in 1.4: */<br>
  .navMainSearch {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;float: right;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0.5em;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
/**************************/</span><br>
<br>
<br>
</li>
</ol></li>
  <li><span class="style1 error">PayPal Users:</span> <span class="error">If you are using the PayPal payment module, you will need to Remove and re-Install the PayPal module in Admin-&gt;Modules-&gt;Payment-&gt;PayPal in order to take advantage of the bugfixes in the module.</span> (Write down your settings first, for easier re-configuration!) <br>
  <br>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>UPGRADING YOUR TEMPLATES </h1>
Since version 1.2, Zen Cart&trade; has had a major overhaul of the templating system for v1.3.  As such, you have two options:
<ul>
<li>
upgrade your existing template by applying the new stylesheet and moving a few lines of code around; or</li>
<li><strong>the best way </strong>to have almost-tableless and much tidier template code, is to make a new template (based on template_default or the new &quot;green&quot; classic introduced in v1.3.5) and carefully re-apply your own customizations to the new template system.</li>
</ul>


<p>For further information on template upgrading, see the support-forum discussion on this topic. </p>
