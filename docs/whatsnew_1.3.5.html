<h1>Upgrade Instructions from v1.3.0.2 to 1.3.5</h1>
<p>If you are upgrading <strong><u>from Zen Cart v1.3.0.2</u></strong>, the process is simple:<br>
  - compare all the changed files with the files on your own site... and re-apply your customizations to the new files<br>
  - upload the new files (with your customizations added) to your site<br>
  - upload the <span class="filename">zc_install</span> folder to your server, and run <span class="filename">zc_install/index.php</span> <br>
  ... select <strong>Database Upgrade</strong> from the System Inspection screen. Apply the required updates. </p>
<p>If you are upgrading <strong><u>from a version prior to v1.3.0.2</u></strong>, please follow the instructions in the &quot;<a href="2.readme_how_to_upgrade.html">how to upgrade</a>&quot; documentation in the /docs folder. </p>
<h1>IMPORTANT NOTES </h1>
<ul>
<li><span class="style1">SECURITY:</span><span class="error"> Please be sure to review and apply the <a href="./important_site_security_recommendations.html" target="_blank">Site Security Recommendations</a> to your site prior to taking your shop &quot;live&quot;.</span> If you are uncertain about how site security applies to you, talk to your web host to ensure that you have proper measures in place. <br>
  <br>
  </li>
<li><span class="style1">CSS-per-page</span> coding changes may affect your stylesheet naming conventions. The naming for category pages now properly uses cPath, like: <span class="filename">c_3_10.css</span>, <span class="filename">c_31_52_88.css</span>, etc <br>
  <br>
  </li>
<li><span class="style1">Stylesheet Change:</span> CSS selector<span class="filename"> #cartAttribsList </span>changed to <span class="filename">.cartAttribsList</span> <br> 
  You may need to adjust some templates to accommodate the change. <br>
  NOTE: There are other stylesheet changes/additions. Please review the changes using WinMerge <br>
  <br>
</li>
<li><span class="error"><span class="style1">NOTE TO &quot;CLASSIC&quot; TEMPLATE USERS:</span> IF YOUR SITE IS BASED ON the older &quot;Classic&quot; template, please note that the New Classic is very different. <strong>The new tableless &quot;Classic Contemporary Green&quot; replaces the old table-based &quot;Classic&quot; template.</strong> The folder is STILL named &quot;classic&quot;... so if your site is using a template named &quot;classic&quot;, you will want to either skip upgrading this folder, or be VERY careful to not overwrite your changes.</span><br>
  This is likely a good time to build your own custom template, using a name other than 'Classic'.
<br>
  <br>
</li>
<li><span class="style1">Company Minimum Value:</span> If you have never altered your &quot;Minimum Value&quot; for &quot;<span class="filename">Company</span>&quot; in <span class="filename">Admin-&gt;Configuration-&gt; Minimum Values</span> you may wish to double-check it. The default value for this used to be '2', and in v1.3.5, this minimum is actually validated. Thus, if you don't update this to 0, then you may find customers complaining that they have to enter a company name even for personal registrations. <br>
  <br>
</li>
<li><span class="style1 error">PayPal Users:</span> <span class="error">If you are using the PayPal payment module, you will need to Remove and re-Install the PayPal module in Admin-&gt;Modules-&gt;Payment-&gt;PayPal in order to take advantage of the bugfixes in the module.</span><br>
  <br>
</li>
<li><span class="style1 error">NOTE: for HTMLarea users:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>The<span class="filename"> /htmlarea </span>folder has been MOVED into<span class="filename"> /editors/htmlarea </span></li>
    <li>You should move your old files to the new location before editing, as this will make things go a little smoother. Note that a couple files have changed in the htmlarea folder to accomodate the new folder path. </li>
    <li>This change opens the door to allow for other editors to be integrated. Plugins are available in the downloads area for FCKeditor and TinyMCE editors. <br>
      <br>
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><span class="style1">phpBB file rename.</span>  The file <span class="filename">class.phpBB.php</span> was renamed to lowercase for consistency across webserver platforms. If you fail to rename yours during the upgrade, you will encounter error messages saying that the file cannot be found. <br>
  <br>
</li>
<li><span class="style1">Got a BIG database?</span> Several new indexes are added during the upgrade process. We suggest testing the upgrade after busy hours if you are upgrading a database with large &quot;products&quot; or &quot;orders&quot; tables. </li>
</ul>
<h1>UPGRADING YOUR TEMPLATES </h1>
Since version 1.2, Zen Cart&trade; has had a major overhaul of the templating system for v1.3.  As such, you have two options:
<ul>
<li>
upgrade your existing template by applying the new stylesheet and moving a few lines of code around; or</li>
<li><strong>the best way </strong>to have almost-tableless and much tidier template code, is to make a new template (based on template_default or the new &quot;green&quot; classic introduced in v1.3.5) and carefully re-apply your own customizations to the new template system.</li>
</ul>


<p>For further information on template upgrading, see the support-forum discussion on this topic. </p>
